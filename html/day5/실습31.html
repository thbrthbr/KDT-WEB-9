        “As I relax on the sofa and gaze around a room a thought hits me: this is exactly the place I’ve been
        looking
        for all my life. A little hideaway in some sinkhole somewhere. I’d always thought of it as a secret,
        imaginary
        place, and can barely believe that it actually exists. I close my eyes and take a breath, and wonder of it
        all
        settles over me like a gentle cloud.”
